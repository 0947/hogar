A pluggable Telegram Bot based on the official Telegram [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)

## introduction
Hogar is a pure python Telegram Bot, fully extensible via plugins. Telegram recently announced official support for a [Bot API](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) allowing integrators of all sorts to bring automated interactions to the mobile platform. Hogar aims to provide a platform where once could simply write a plugin and have interactions in a matter of minutes.

## installation
Essensially, all you really need for hogar is a python 2.x interpreter. If you use plugins that need database access, then you will need that too. I will also always suggest you run projects such as this in a python [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) so that the dependencies you install for Hogar dont interfere with the system provided ones. It also makes it easy to restart in case you messed up :)

So here goes:

### clone
The first thing to do is clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leonjza/hogar.git
```
